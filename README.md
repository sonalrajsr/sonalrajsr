| **Design-of-Carriage-and-Guideway-in-Manual-Lathe** | This project focuses on the design, structural analysis, and simulation of a manual lathe machine’s carriage, guideways, and lead screw system — core components responsible for precise tool positioning during machining. | [View Repo](https://github.com/sonalrajsr/Design-of-Carriage-and-Guideway-in-Manual-Lathe) |
| **Data-Driven-Fluid-Mechanics-Project**       | The aim of this project is to extract meaningful insights from video frames capturing fluid dynamics experiments      | [View Repo](https://github.com/sonalrajsr/Data-Driven-Fluid-Mechanics-Project) |
| 🔍 **Image-Segmentation-and-Object-Analysis**      | This project is an AI-powered pipeline designed for image segmentation and object identification. The pipeline segments objects within images and identifies them using state-of-the-art deep learning models. It also includes the ability to extract and store segmented objects, generate textual descriptions, and present the results through an interactive web application built with Streamlit.        | [View Repo](https://github.com/sonalrajsr/Image-Segmentation-and-Object-Analysis) |
